## Task
- Run a local WordPress site on your computer  
- Install and activate the **All-in-One WP Migration** plugin
- Import this backup:  
  [lifepaws-demo.wpress](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tn1eefwYSOFt2UgLs3cDh9zAGgRcvAgB/view?usp=drive_link)  
- Find the user `intern_test` and reset the password so you can log in  
- Document your steps and how you fixed any issues in /docs, or add screenshots of your solutions in /screenshots

## What to deliver
- Fork this repo into your own GitHub  
- Create a branch called `intern/<your-name>`  
- Commit your work and open a Pull Request to `main`  
- Include:
  - Notes on what you did
  - Screenshots (e.g. logged into dashboard)
  - Any scripts or commands you used

## Bonus (optional)
- Write a small script to automate part of your setup (e.g. plugin install, password reset)  
- Explain how you would handle a backup larger than the upload limit  
- Suggest one or two improvements to make WordPress more secure  
- Add a quick health check (command or script) to show the site is running

## What we look at
- Can you set up the environment

- How you reset the password safely  
- Clarity of your notes and commits
